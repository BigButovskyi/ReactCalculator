    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The Moon is an astronomical body orbiting Earth as its only natural satellite. It is the
        fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System, and by far[13] the largest among planetary satellites relative to
        the
        size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). The Moon is, after Jupiter's satellite Io, the second-densest
        satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely accepted
        explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a
        hypothetical
        Mars-sized body called Theia. New research of Moon rocks, although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis, suggests
        that the Moon may be older than previously thought.[14]</p>
    <p>
        The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, and thus always shows the same side to Earth, the near side.
        Because
        of libration, slightly more than half (about 59%) of the total lunar surface can be viewed from Earth.[15] The
        near
        side is marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the
        prominent impact craters. After the Sun, the Moon is the second-brightest celestial object regularly visible in
        Earth's sky. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a
        reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean
        tides,
        body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.
